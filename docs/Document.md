# Joy


## Syntax

Very simple syntax.  Could be specified as a sequence of one or more terms:

    joy ::= term term*

Conceptually, all terms are unary functions `F :: stack -> stack` that accept a stack and return a stack.  But we immediately differentiate between literals (of a few kinds), functions, and combinators (which like higher-order functions.)

### In Joyoy there are currently four literal types.

First we have the types borrowed from the underlying Python semantics. **Strings** (byte and Unicode with nuances depending on whether you're running under Python 2 or 3), **ints**, and **floats**.  Then there is the **sequence** type, aka "quote", "list", etc...  In joy it is represented by enclosing zero or more terms in square brackets:

    sequence :== '[' term* ']'

(In Joypy it is implemented as a cons-list.  All datastructures in Joypy are built out of this single sequence type, including the stack and expression.)

    literal ::= string | int | float | sequence

Functions accept zero or more arguments from the stack and push back zero or more results.

Combinators are functions one or more of the arguments to which are quotes containing joy expressions, and which then execute one or more of their quoted arguments to effect their function.

    term ::= literal | function | combinator

## Joypy Continuation-Passing Style

In Joypy all the combinators work by modifying the pending expression.  We have enlarged the definition of function to be from a two-tuple of `(stack, expression)` to another such two-tuple:

    F :: (stack, expression) -> (stack, expression)

Simple functions ignore the expression and pass it through unchanged, combinators do not.  They can modify it and this is enough to define control-flow and other operators.

The code for the parser is in `joy/parser.py`.

## Evaluation

The joy interpreter is a very simple loop.  As long as the expression is non-empty the interpreter pops the next term and checks it, if it's a literal it is pushed onto the stack, if it's a function or combinators the interpreter calls it, passing the current stack and expression, which are then replaced by whatever the function or combinator returns.

There is no call stack.  All state is kept either on the stack or in the pending expression.  At each interpreter iteration the stack and expression are complete.  (They can be pickled, saved to disc or sent over the network, and reconstituted at any time, etc...)

# Methods of Meta-programming

Joy seems to lend itself to several complementary forms of meta-programming to develop more-efficient versions of functions.

## Partial Evaluation

Cf. "Futamura projections"

["partial evaluation is a technique for several different types of program optimization by specialization. The most straightforward application is to produce new programs which run faster than the originals while being guaranteed to behave in the same way."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation) ~Wikipedia

Given a function and some (but not all) of its arguments you can run the interpreter in a speculative fashion and derive new functions that are specializions of the original.

Example from [Futamura, 1983](https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/103401/1/0482-14.pdf) of converting a power function to a "to the fifth power" function:

       k u F
    -----------
        u^k

Joy function:

    F == 1 [popop 0 !=] [[popop odd] [over *] [] ifte [2 >>] dipd [sqr] dip] while [popop] dip

This is a bit longer than a definition should be.  In practice I would refactor it to be more concise and easily understood.

In Python for comparision:

    def power(k, u):
        z = 1
        while k != 0:
            if k % 2:
                z = z * u
            k = k >> 1
            u = u * u
        return z

Using 5 for `k` and pushing evaluation forward as far as it will go with a sort of "thunk" variable for `u` we arrive at:

    u u u * dup * *

We can replace the extra occurances of `u` with `dup` to arrive at a definition for a Joy function that, given a number on the stack, returns that number raised to the fifth power:

    to-the-fifth == dup dup * dup * *

Here it is in action:

    u dup dup * dup * *
    u u   dup * dup * *
    u u u     * dup * *
    u u^2       dup * *
    u u^2 u^2       * *
    u u^4             *
    u^5

## GÃ¶del Machine

http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedelmachine.html

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_machine

In Joy it often happens that a new general form is discovered that is semantically equivalent to some other form but that has greater efficiency (at least under some definite conditions.)  When this happens we can perform a kind of search-and-replace operation over the whole of the current dictionary (standard library in other languages) and achieve performance gains.

In general the total refactoring of the stardard dictionary is NP, however we are allowed to "cheat" in any fashion we can, for example by using humans "oracles".  (I fully intend to have machines in a closet soemwhere grinding through the configuration space to try to find shortenings.)

Joy function defintions form Directed Graphs.  Not acyclical though, definition bodies do not contain references to other functions, but rather "Symbols" that name functions, so you can form e.g. two definitions that each make use of the other.  Generally speaking though, you don't do this, instead you write defintions that use e.g. `genrec` general recursion combinator. 

Anyway, because Joy code is just a graph it becomes pretty easy to rewrite the graph in ways that preserve the semantics but are more efficient.  Doing this in an automated fashion is essentially Schmidhuber's GÃ¶del Machine:  Finding and applying provably-correct modifications to the whole system in a self-referencial way to create a self-improving general problem solver.

Joy is intended as an effective vehicle for exploring this potential.


## Speculative pre-evaluation

If you examine the traces of Joy programs it's easy to find places in the pending expression where some speculative interpreter could pre-compute results whiel the main interpreter was prosecuting the main "thread" of the program.  For example consider (with the `.` indicating the current "location of the interpeter head" if you will, the split between the stack and the expression):

    ... a b c . F 2 3 + G H

The `2 3 +` between `F` and `G` is not at the interpreter "head" yet it is extrememly unlikely that any function `F` will prevent it (eventually) being evaluated to `5`.  We can imagine an interpreter that detects this sort of thing and "tags" the expression at `2` with the result `5`.  If evaluation reaches `2` the interpreter can just use `5` without re-evaluating the whole subexpression `2 3 +`.

## JIT





# Math, Physics, Computation

    Computational algorithms are used to communicate precisely
    some of the methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena.
    Expressing the methods of variational mechanics in a computer
    language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally
    effective. Computation requires us to be precise about the repre-
    sentation of mechanical and geometric notions as computational
    objects and permits us to represent explicitly the algorithms for
    manipulating these objects. Also, once formalized as a procedure,
    a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can be used directly to
    compute results.

# Sympy Library

The mathematical functions in the Joypy library wrap the `math` module and other builtins for the most part.  It would be a simple matter to write wrapper functions for e.g. the Sympy packages' functions and provide symbolic math capabilities.
