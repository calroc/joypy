# Some Jupyter Notebooks and other material.

- Basic Use of Joy in a Notebook
- Developing a Program - Working with the first problem from Project Euler, "Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000", several forms of the program are derived.
- Factorial Function and Paramorphisms - A basic pattern of recursive control-flow.
- Generator Programs - Using the x combinator to make generator programs which can be used to create unbounded streams of values.
- Hylo-, Ana-, Cata-morphisms - Some basic patterns of recursive control-flow structures.
- Library Examples - Short examples of each word in the dictionary.  Various formats.
- Quadratic - Not-so-annoying Quadratic Formula.
- Replacing Functions in the Dictionary - Shows the basics of defining new "primitive" functions in Python or as definitions and adding them to the dictionary.
- Zipper - An preliminary examination of the idea of data-structure "zippers" for traversing datastructures.
- notebook_preamble.py - Imported into notebooks to simply the preamble code.
- pe1.py pe1.txt - Set up and execute a Joy program for the first problem from Project Euler. The pe1.txt file is the trace.  It's 2.8M uncompressed.  Compressed with gzip it becomes just 0.12M.
- repl.py - Run this script to start a REPL.  Useful for e.g. running Joy code in a debugger.
