§ Functions

  stack → stack
  note() decorator
  define several functions
  wrap functions from Python operator module


We can catagorize functions into those that rearrange things on the stack
but don't otherwise process them, those that perform some process on
them, and those that call back into the joy() function to execute one or
more quoted programs themselves.  And, of course, there are commands that
do more than one or all three.

Commands that execute quoted programs are called "Combinators" and
they are the key to Joy's expressiveness and power.  The joy()
function by itself wouldn't accomplish much but with the availability of
several combinators it becomes a powerhouse.

Commands that just rearrange things on the stack can be written in python
as simple tuple unpacking and repacking.

Definitions, functions defined by equations, refactoring and how
important it is..
