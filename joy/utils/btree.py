BTree
=================================

This is a simple Binary Tree implementation that uses tuples in such a
way as to permit "persistant" usage, i.e. all previous versions of the
btree datastructures are retained and available (provided you don't throw
them away yourself.)

The empty tree is represented as an empty tuple.  Nodes are a tuple
consisting of a key, a value, and two (possible empty) sub-nodes for the
lower and higher branches of the tree.

This module defines the following functions:

  insert(node, key, value)

  get(node, key)

  delete(node, key)

Both insert() and delete() return a new tuple that is the result of
applying the operation to the existing node.  (And both get() and delete()
will raise KeyErrors if the key is not in the tree.)

Because of the way that insert() and delete() are written, only as much
of the tree is changed as necessary and the rest of it is reused. This
provides persistance without using up memory for each version of the
tree.

These functions are implemented recursively so they have the potential to
raise a RuntimeError if the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.  This
should only be a problem if used with very large trees.  To avoid this
issue you can use sys.setrecursionlimit(), but I think I might just
rewrite these to not use recursion.

  # lower sub-tree, take its key and value to replace (delete) our own,
  # then get rid of it by recursively calling delete() on our lower
  # sub-node with our new key.
  # (We could also find the lowest node in our higher sub-tree and take
  # its key and value and delete it. I only implemented one of these
  # two symmetrical options. Over a lot of deletions this might make
  # the tree more unbalanced.  Oh well.)
